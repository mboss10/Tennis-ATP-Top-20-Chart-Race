## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to use the Huge Tennis Database that you can find on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis) to mine tennis data and put together an animated chart race of the Top 20 ATP tennis player from 1990 to 2024.

## Process

I went through the following steps:
1. Database Setup: Creating the DB environment in DBeaver.
2. Data Cleaning: Using SQL views to ensure clean and accurate data.
3. Visualization: Importing the dataset into Tableau and building the dashboard with design elements inspired by the official ATP website.

I will detail below the different steps.
